The human eyes see in 2D, but use context clues to transform that 2D environment into 3D. These clues include:
1. Accommodation: Your eye changes focus to something farther away or closer. 
2. Vergence: Using both eyes to identify an object's location
3. Disparity: Using the difference between what you've previously seen and what you're currently seeing. 
	1. These two combined are **stereo**.
