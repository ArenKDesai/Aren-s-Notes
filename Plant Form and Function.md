## Plant Organs
The cell organs are made up of different tissues. 

Plant cells are primarily separated into three types to manage these organs. 
These are **Parenchyma**, **Collenchyma**, and **Sclerenchyma** cells. 
There's also simple tissues, made of only one cell type, or complex tissues, which are made of more than one type. 
Other types also exist, such as trichomes or endodermis. 

### Parenchyma
The basic plant cell. When cell division occurs, the cell starts as a parenchyma cell. These are thin-walled, actively dividing, and have diverse functions. These include leaf mesophyll, pith of stem, and the inside of a potato. 

### Collenchyma
Simple tissues made up of one cell type. These are supportive tissue. 

### Sclerenchyma
Hard cells that are even more thickened and hard than collenchyma cells. These are what make wood. 
There are two main types: sclere
