Much of this is an extension of [[Plant Cells]]
## Plant Organs
The cell organs are made up of different tissues. 

Plant cells are primarily separated into three types to manage these organs. 
These are **Parenchyma**, **Collenchyma**, and **Sclerenchyma** cells. 
There's also simple tissues, made of only one cell type, or complex tissues, which are made of more than one type. 
Other types also exist, such as trichomes or endodermis.
