#Unity #Graphics 

From Jasper Flick's Unity Tutorial series. 

Objects in Unity can have many fields, but some, such as basic cylinders, contain three default fields:
1. Mesh filters, which contain a reference to built-in mesh defining the object. 
2. Mesh renderers, which ensure the mesh gets rendered, and determines what material the object gets render
