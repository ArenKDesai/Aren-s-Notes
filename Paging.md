We want to speed up address translation, so we use a **translation-lookaside buffer (TLB)**. This is a part of the **memory-management unit (MMU)**, and it caches address translations. The TLB acts like a typical cache that keeps high-frequency address translations in on-chip memory. 

Old architectures had **hardware-managed TLBs**
