## Genetics
No two siblings are identical (besides identical twins), but how do traits get inherited? Gregor Mendel discovered that offspring often gets traits more similar to one parent than another (rather than being a blend of the two). This means that traits are inherited as separate factors called **Mendelian Inheritance**. 
He also discovered the existence of dominant traits. 

Mendel used **cross-pollination** to study inheritance. Normally, pea flowers self-pollinate, creating pure-bred lines. C
