## Genetics
No two siblings are identical (besides identical twins), but how do traits get inherited? Gregor Mendel discovered that offspring often gets traits more similar to one parent than another (rather than being a blend of the two). This means that traits are inherited as separate factors called **Mendelian Inheritance**. 
He also discovered the existence of dominant traits. 

Mendel used **cross-pollination** to study inheritance. Normally, pea flowers self-pollinate, creating pure-bred lines. Mendel took the pollen from one plant and transferred it to another, which allowed him to target for traits. 
He examined seven traits and discovered which traits were **dominant** (expressed) or **recessive** (masked). This was the F1 generation. 
He then **selfed** the F1 generation to create the F2 generation and discovered that the recessive traits would show up 25% of the time. 
He defined the **Law of Dominance** as the law defining that the expressive allels are dominant and the masked trait is recessive. The law that
