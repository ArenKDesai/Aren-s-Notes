## Primitives
Light (generally) travels in straight lines, and for computers, is generally drawn with RGB values of 255 - 0. We also cannot actually see in 3D, we see in 2D and interpolate from those images. 

Physically-based rendering is possible where we simulate photons (think ray-tracing). However, we typically use primitive-based rendering. This is why we call elements **primitives**.

We draw elements from nodes with (x,y) fixed positions or variable positions.
