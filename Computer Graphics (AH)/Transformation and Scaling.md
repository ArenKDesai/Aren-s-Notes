A transformation is a movement of a primitive, like an addition onto the coordinate axes. You can also translate the coordinate system itself, which may require a context save and restore so context changes aren't permanent. 

It's usually good practice to build objects at (0,0) since it standardizes functions and placement (even with parameters), so most functions translate the coordinate system, not place something far away. This is especially important for scaling.
