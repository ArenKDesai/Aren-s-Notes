To begin with, we need to understand what a shape is. We'll define a shape as a set of points. A curve is a set of points drawn with a pen, where most points have two neighbors. 
You generate a curve through a function, typically a continuous one that converges into your curve. The function is a function over time and space. These are parametric curves. 

When trying to fit a curve to a set of $n$ points there are options. The easiest would be to make linear line segments with a first-degree polymomial, and second easiest would be to make an $n-1$ degree polynomial.
