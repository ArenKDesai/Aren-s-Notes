A **biome** is a large geographic region defined by climate and vegetation type. These are regional or global, and may contain multiple ecosystems. **Ecosystems** are communities of plants and animals interacting with their environments --- local or regional in scale, living and non-living, defined by interactions. 
The structure of an ecosystem is comprised of the different species that live there, including relative abundance of each species (proportion of all individuals) and spatial distribution of individuals. 
The population growth rate in a habitat / ecosystem is the birth rate minus the death rate, and the carrying capacity (K) is the maximum number of individuals the ecosystem can support at r=0.
