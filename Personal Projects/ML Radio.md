## Main Concepts
- Build a radio that continually plays songs with Spotify API
- Train the recommendation algorithm with machine learning, but not on Spotify data (illegal)

### Future Ideas
- Make it so a user can input a prompt and generate a playlist off the prompt

### Current Tasks
- [ ] Create requirements.txt
- [ ] Figure out how to get submit button to work (send input to python & start radio)
- [ ] Fix get_next_song to compare next song to array of vectors with smallest Euclidean distance instead of single song distance

### APIs
