You can break ML problems into supervised and unsupervised problems. Unsupervised problems are solved via clustering algorithms or autoencoders, which reduce the dimensionality of input data ([[Principal Component Analysis]]).  Another use case is *topic modelling*, which clusters sets of documents.
