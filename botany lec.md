## Review
The stem often takes a pattern in the middle of a large pool of stuff. 
Xylem is the stuff that conducts water in a root. Phloem conducts nutrients.
Wood is produced by the vascular cambium and is made of secondary xylem. The paricycle produces produces lateral roots. 
Monocot stems have scattered vessels of xylem and phloem that aggregates near the sides. They can't grow laterally because they don't have the organelles for it. 

## Plant Reproduction and Life Cycles
As mentioned previously, there are two main types of reproduction for plants:
1. Angiosperms: use flowers to produce seeds
2. Gymnosperms: make seeds w/ no flowers. Instead, cones
Seedless plants (ferns and mosses) disperse offspring w/ **spores**. 
For reproduction in flowers:
- Sperm is in pollen from **anthers** (end bits of flower tendrils, which are the **stamen**)
- **Ovules** (w/ eggs) are in ovary
- Pollination transfers pollen to ovules
- Fertilization fuses egg & sperm
- Embryo in is in seed, which is in fruit
Not all plants have flowers, and not all reproduction is sexual. For example, ferns use spores. Some plants can reproduce sexually and non-sexually. 

All prokaryotes are asexual. They do not have reproductive organs, and instead just kinda divide. Prokaryotes, like green algae, under mitosis, send out **zoospores** and undergo mitosis again. 

### Asexual Reproduction
Produces genetically identical offspring (clones) via mitosis ([[Plant Cells]]). There are a few common methods:
1. **Vegetative propagation**. Plants form as a random number of offshoots, kinda like vertical tree of clones. Ex: runners in strawberries, the "eyes" of potatoes, aspen clones, etc. 
2. **Fragmentation**. A part breaks off and can regrow somewhere else. For example, willows, bryophytes, duckweed, etc. 
3. **Apomixis**. Seeds, or embryos, produced w/o fertilization. 

### Sexual Reproduction
Producing offspring through **meiosis** and fertilization. These are done with **diploids** cells, cells that process two complete sets of chromosomes (one from mom/dad). These chromosomes are **homologous** to each-other, known as **homologs**. **Haploid** cells only have one set of chromosomes (no pairs) because they arise from asexual reproduction. 
So, to summarize:
- A pair of chromosomes is two chromosomes, one paternal and one maternal
- One chromosome is one stick
- Genes are regions of DNA code for a trait
- Allels are different versions of the same gene

Sexual reproduction starts with **meiosis**, cell division that halves homologous chromosomes. Then, **fertilization** occurs, where a fusion of haploid **gametes** produce a diploid cell called a **zygote**. The gametes come from the split homologous chromosomes in the form of sperm or eggs. 

Sexual reproduction allows for much greater genetic variation, which is very beneficial for natural selection. However, it requires a lot of energy, and depends on factors like water, temperature, pollinators, etc. 
Asexual reproduction can take advantage of environmental factors, while sexual reproduction allows for the purging of disadvantageous traits. 

### Plant Life Cycle
Plants alternate generations. They alternate between **sporophytes** and **gametophytes**. 
Sporophytes are $2n$ multi-cellular bodies that can generate $2n$ reproductive cells, which undergo meiosis to generate a bunch of $1n$ spores.
