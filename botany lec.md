## Earth Before Life
541 mya: **Phanerozoic** Era begins. Dawn of the **Cambrian explosion** of life on land. This is the newest era. 
No plants or animals on land. Life only existed in ocean. Only 10% of today's oxygen. 

Plants back then had to deal with gravity, drying and UV damage, water and nutrients delivery, fertilization, etc. The first to evolve these traits were the **bryophytes**.

Land plants descended from Streptophyte green algae. The algae had no apical meristems and no true tissues. The unprotected spores were just released into the water.
