Leaves intercept light, harvest a range of light on the energy spectrum, and store the captured energy. Water gets pulled up through the stem via the Cohesion-Tension theorem. 

The point on the stem where leaves attach is the **node**, which connects to the **petiole** that works as a connection between the node and the **blade** of the leaf. When the leaf falls off, an axillary bud gets left behind. 
Leaves are arranged in either **alternate**, **opposite**, or the other one.
