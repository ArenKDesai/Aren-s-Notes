## Review




### Asexual Reproduction
Produces genetically identical offspring (clones) via mitosis ([[Plant Cells]]). There are a few common methods:
1. **Vegetative propagation**. Plants form as a random number of offshoots, kinda like vertical tree of clones. Ex: runners in strawberries, the "eyes" of potatoes, aspen clones, etc. 
2. **Fragmentation**. A part breaks off and can regrow somewhere else. For example, willows, bryophytes, duckweed, etc. 
3. **Apomixis**. Seeds, or embryos, produced w/o fertilization. 

### Sexual Reproduction
Producing offspring through **meiosis** and fertilization. These are done with **diploids** cells, cells that process two complete sets of chromosomes (one from mom/dad). These chromosomes are **homologous** to each-other, known as **homologs**. **Haploid** cells only have one set of chromosomes (no pairs) because they arise from asexual reproduction. 
So, to summarize:
- A pair of chromosomes is two chromosomes, one paternal and one maternal
- One chromosome is one stick
- Genes are regions of DNA code for a trait
- Allels are different versions of the same gene

Sexual reproduction starts with **meiosis**, cell division that halves homologous chromosomes. Then, **fertilization** occurs, where a fusion of haploid **gametes** produce a diploid cell called a **zygote**. The gametes come from the split homologous chromosomes in the form of sperm or eggs. 

Sexual reproduction allows for much greater genetic variation, which is very beneficial for natural selection. However, it requires a lot of energy, and depends on factors like water, temperature, pollinators, etc. 
Asexual reproduction can take advantage of environmental factors, while sexual reproduction allows for the purging of disadvantageous traits. 

Crossing over, or **recombination**, occurs during prophase. 

### Plant Life Cycle
Plants alternate generations. They alternate between **sporophytes** and **gametophytes**. 
Sporophytes are $2n$ multi-cellular bodies that can generate $2n$ reproductive cells, which undergo meiosis to generate a bunch of $1n$ spores. These grow via mitosis and form a $1n$ multi-cellular body, which generates gametes. 

In plants, meiosis takes place in the **sporangia** of the sporophyte, and produces spores. Flowering plants have male sorangia in anthers, female sporangia in ovary. 

Meiosis has meitosis phases (P->M->A->T), but it has two sets of phases. First, it splits the homologous chromosome pairs. Then, it runs it back to separate the diploid cells into haploid cells.
