## Review
The stem often takes a pattern in the middle of a large pool of stuff. 
Xylem is the stuff that conducts water in a root. Phloem conducts nutrients.
Wood is produced by the vascular cambium and is made of secondary xylem. The paricycle produces produces lateral roots. 
Monocot stems have scattered vessels of xylem and phloem that aggregates near the sides. They can't grow laterally because they don't have the organelles for it. 

## Plant Reproduction and Life Cycles
As mentioned previously, there are two main types of reproduction for plants:
1. Angiosperms: use flowers to produce seeds
2. Gymnosperms: make seeds w/ no flowers. Instead, cones
Seedless plants (ferns and mosses) disperse offspring w/ **spores**. 
For reproduction in flowers:
- Sperm is in pollen from **anthers** (end bits of flower tendrils, which are the **stamen**)
- **Ovules** (w/ eggs) are in ovary
- Pollination transfers pollen to ovules
- Fertilization fuses egg & sperm
- Embryo in is in seed, which is in fruit
Not all plants have flowers, and not all reproduction is sexual. For example, ferns use spores
