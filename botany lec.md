## Leaves
Leaves intercept light, harvest a range of light on the energy spectrum, and store the captured energy. Water gets pulled up through the stem via the Cohesion-Tension theorem. 

The point on the stem where leaves attach is the **node**, which connects to the **petiole** that works as a connection between the node and the **blade** of the leaf. When the leaf falls off, an axillary bud gets left behind. 
Leaves are arranged in either **alternate** (one leaf per node), **opposite** (two leaves per node), or **whorled leaves** ($\ge 3$ leaves per node). 
**Simple** leaves have just one blade. **Compound leaves** have multiple blades, called **leaflets**. These can often look like a stem, but you can tell it's a compound leaf when there's a node on the stem. 

The **leaf margin** refers to the outer edge of the leaf or leaflet. The **leaf venation** refers to the pattern of the vascular tissue in the leaf. 

There are two big groups of flowering plants:
1. **Angiosperm**: produces seeds and flowers 
2. **Eudicots**: 75% of plants
3. **Monocots**: 23% of plants. Includes grasses, lilies, and orchids. Undergo C4 ([[Plant Cells]]) photosynthesis. 
Monocot / Dicot / Eudicots are all named after the number of **cotyledons** that hold the nutrition in the seed. 

For example, grass has a monocot leaf with parallel veins. It has a simple leaf blade and a sheath clasping stem. 
### Leaf Anatomy
The leaf is enclosed in the **epidermis**, which includes the occasional **stomata** to let in light for photosynthesis on the lower epidermis. Spongy parenchyma helps $CO_2$ get to the palisade layers. There are hairs and glands that help hold the water right under the upper epidermis. **Xylem** carries water through the leaf. There are also** fibers** that surround the vascular system for reinforcement. 
The primary vein is covered by the xylem and phloem, and strengthened with collenchyma tissue. 

The **stomata** (the openings) are usually on the lower surface of the epidermis in the millions per inch. A single **stoma** is characterized by the **guard cells** that surround the opening that can open and close to protect the leaf through turgor variation. 
$K^+$ ions are brought in by an uptake using carrier proteins to regulate stomatal opening. 

Trichomes (hairs) on the leaves are modified epidermal cells that extend from the surface. They have a lot of functions: retaining temperature, reducing water loss, absorbing water, defense, etc. 

Movement cells regulate the movement of leaves that get engorged in water. The leaf opens when the movement cells are full of water, and closes when its empty. 

There are three types of plants that cover habitats:
1. Mesophytes: Live in moderately moist environments
2. Hydrophytes: plants that live in or partly in water
3. Xerophytes: plants that live in arid environments

### Mesophytes
There are typically more adaptions for light rather than water. There can be a lot of shade that disallows lower leaves to produce energy. This separates leaves into **sun leaves** and **shade leaves**. 

### Hydrophytes
Think of lily pad. The stomata are typically on the upper surface on the floating part of the plant, or the leaves just don't have stomata if they're submerged. The aerenchyma are used to facilitate gas exchange and floatation, and there's no (or a thin) cuticle, with less xylem than phloem. 

### Xerophytes
These have adaptations to minimize water loss. This is usually a thick epidermis and cuticle, stomata sunken into cryptes, and energy being allocated to the roots. 

One interesting xerophyte is **cacti** and other **succulents**. These have water-storing tissues to keep as much water as possible. Cacti have leaves modified into spines that reduce water loss and defend the plant, while the stem conducts photosynthesis and store water. Other succulents have thick water-storing leaves as well, and may be moderately spiny. Most succulents have CAM ([[Plant Cells]]) photosynthesis. 

#### Bracts
Bracts are a special case of leaves that
