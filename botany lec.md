## Leaves
Leaves intercept light, harvest a range of light on the energy spectrum, and store the captured energy. Water gets pulled up through the stem via the Cohesion-Tension theorem. 

The point on the stem where leaves attach is the **node**, which connects to the **petiole** that works as a connection between the node and the **blade** of the leaf. When the leaf falls off, an axillary bud gets left behind. 
Leaves are arranged in either **alternate** (one leaf per node), **opposite** (two leaves per node), or **whorled leaves** ($\ge 3$ leaves per node). 
**Simple** leaves have just one blade. **Compound leaves** have multiple blades, called **leaflets**. These can often look like a stem, but you can tell it's a compound leaf when there's a node on the stem. 

The **leaf margin** refers to the outer edge of the leaf or leaflet. The **leaf venation** refers to the pattern of the vascular tissue in the leaf. 

There are two big groups of flowering plants:
1. **Angiosperm**: produces seeds and flowers 
2. **Eudicots**: 75% of plants
3. **Monocots**: 23% of plants. Includes grasses, lilies, and orchids. Undergo C4 photosynthesis. 
Monocot / Dicot / Eudicots are all named after the number of **cotyledons** that hold the nutrition in the seed. 

For example, grass has a monocot leaf with parallel veins. It has a simple leaf blade and a sheath clasping stem. 
### Leaf Anatomy
The leaf is enclosed in the **epidermis**, which includes the occasional **stomata** to let in light for photosynthesis on the lower epidermis. Spongy parenchyma helps There are hairs and glands that help hold the water right under the upper epidermis.
