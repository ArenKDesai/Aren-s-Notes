## Intro
- Courts and law enforcement agencies across the U.S., as well as certain other countries, employ predictive algorithms for a variety of purposes, including risk assessment in sentencing, predicting locations where crime is likely to occur, and identifying those likely to commit criminal acts in the near future (2)
- There is no consensus definition of algorithmic opacity, but we understand an algorithm to count as opaque to some degree just in case (a) facts about the contribution of any single feature of the world to the algorithm’s final determination cannot be easily accessed, either by the human decision-maker or by persons affected by the determination, or (b) the way that the algorithmic determination figures in decision-making cannot be easily understood (2).
