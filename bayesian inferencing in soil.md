$PM_{2.5}$ (particulate matter), formed from wildfire, traffic, etc., is bad for us. Notice there's a lot of potential sources of particulate matter. So how do we figure out the fraction of $PM_{2.5}$ that comes from what sources? This is **source apportionment**. 
Unfortunately, our monitors is static; the air pollution could be from one minute, hour, day ago, etc. 
The basic source apportionment model is:
$Y=GH+e$
