## Botany Basics

Botany studies plants, algae, and fungi. It includes plant ecology, anatomy, physiology, economic botany, ethnobotany, mycology, phycology, etc. Applied botany includes agronomy, horticulture, forestry, etc. 

Photosynthesis can be summarized into the formula: $6CO_2+12H_2O->C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2+6H_2O$
Light reactions: Water split, produces oxygen. 
Dark reactions (Calvin cycle): $CO_2$ is reduced, producing sugar. 

Cellular respiration: $C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2->6CO_2+6H_2O$. The $6O_2$ is used as energy. 

The oxygen that plants produce interacts with UV (UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C) rays in the atmosphere to create the ozone ($O_3$) layer, which shields us from radiation. 

## Onto Plants

Plants are eukaryotic (advanced), multicellular, sessile (arose from unicellular ancestors) organisms. They have rigid cell walls of cellulose that animal cells don't have.
