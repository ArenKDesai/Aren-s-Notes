Botany studies plants, algae, and fungi. It includes plant ecology, anatomy, physiology, economic botany, ethnobotany, mycology, phycology, etc. Applied botany includes agronomy, horticulture, forestry, etc. 

Photosynthesis can be summarized into the formula: $6CO_2+12H_2O->C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2+6H_2O$
Light reactions: Water split, produces oxygen. 
Dark reactions (Calvin cycle): $CO_2$ is reduced, producing sugar. 

Cellular respiration: $C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2->6CO_2+6H_2O$
