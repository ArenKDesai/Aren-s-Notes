## Review
Amino acid chains for peptide bonds (polypeptides). 20 amino acids are defined by R-group. 
Structural proteins rely on enzymes to turn things on/off. 

DNA and RNA are made of nucleotides (N-base + 5C sugar + phosphate). DNA contains the AT / CG pairs and is double stranded (unless undergoing polymerase stripping). RNA swaps T(hymine) for U(racil), and is a single strand. 
RNA includes:
1. mRNA: transcribes DNA code during transcription and carries to ribosome
2. tRNA: transfers amino acids to mRNA during transla
