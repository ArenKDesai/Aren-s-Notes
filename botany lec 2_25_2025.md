## Review
Amino acid chains for peptide bonds (polypeptides). 20 amino acids are defined by R-group. 
Structural proteins rely on enzymes to turn things on/off. 

DNA and RNA are made of nucleotides (N-base + 5C sugar + phosphate). DNA contains the AT / CG pairs and is double stranded (unless undergoing polymerase stripping). RNA swaps T(hymine) for U(racil), and is a single strand. 

## RNA and Amino Acids
RNA includes:
1. mRNA: transcribes DNA code during transcription and carries to ribosome
2. tRNA: transfers amino acids to mRNA during translation to build polypeptides. 
3. rRNA: ribosomal RNA: building block of ribosome. 

Structural Genes: regions of the DNA that code for a particular protein. Usually 1000 kilobases long. Some traits are controlled via >1 gene. Each amino acid is coded by 3 nucleotides, known as a **triplet codon**. 

The non-coding regions are the other parts of the DNA that are non-genes. This can be up to 95% or more of the DNA. This could code for gene expression regulators, spacers (known as **introns**), centomeres and telomeres, genes to make RNA, etc. 

Each amino acid corresponds to a 3 nucleotide **codon**. There are 20 amino acids total, 9 of which humans can only get from food. 

Each amino acid is coded by a 3-nucleotide codon and there are 4 nucleotides for RNA, so there are $4^3=64$ possible codons. AUG is the "start" codon. There are three stop codons: UGA, UAA, and U
