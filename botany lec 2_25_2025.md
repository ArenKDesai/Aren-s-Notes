## Review
Amino acid chains for peptide bonds (polypeptides). 20 amino acids are defined by R-group. 
Structural proteins rely on enzymes to turn things on/off. 

DNA and RNA are made of nucleotides (N-base + 5C sugar + phosphate). DNA contains the AT / CG pairs and is double stranded (unless undergoing polymerase stripping). RNA swaps T(hymine) for U(racil), and is a single strand. 

**exons** are sets of useful DNA and **introns** are useless. DNA is wound around histomes. 

## RNA and Amino Acids
RNA includes:
1. mRNA: transcribes DNA code during transcription and carries to ribosome
2. tRNA: transfers amino acids to mRNA during translation to build polypeptides. 
3. rRNA: ribosomal RNA: building block of ribosome. 

Structural Genes: regions of the DNA that code for a particular protein. Usually 1000 kilobases long. Some traits are controlled via >1 gene. Each amino acid is coded by 3 nucleotides, known as a **triplet codon**. 

The non-coding regions are the other parts of the DNA that are non-genes. This can be up to 95% or more of the DNA. This could code for gene expression regulators, spacers (known as **introns**), centomeres and telomeres, genes to make RNA, etc. 

Each amino acid corresponds to a 3 nucleotide **codon**. There are 20 amino acids total, 9 of which humans can only get from food. 

Each amino acid is coded by a 3-nucleotide codon and there are 4 nucleotides for RNA, so there are $4^3=64$ possible codons. AUG is the "start" codon. There are three stop codons: UGA, UAA, and UAG. 

### Transfer RNA (tRNA)
Always floating around the cytoplasm, made in the nucleus. It's a specialized folding of a single strand of RNA that is held together by hydrogen bonds. An **anticodon** attaches to mRNA. 

### Synthetase
An enzyme that binds amino acids to tRNA and recognizes the R-group. There's a unique tRNA for each amino acid matched to A.A. by its 3 nucleotide anticodon. Complementary to mRNA codon. 

## DNA Transcription
There are two main stages: 
1. Transcription: DNA -> mRNA
2. Translation: mRNA -> Protein

### Transcription
Occurs in the nucleus. The process:
1. DNA unwinds. RNA polymerase binds to promoter region of a gene. 
2. mRNA synthesis. 
3. mRNA processing. Introns are removed, exons are spliced together, a protective cap and tail are added. 
The finished mRNA strand exits the nucleus and a ribosome finds it. 

### Translation
This occurs in the cytoplasm at the ribosome. mRNA carries the genetic code, tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome, and the ribosome assembles proteins. Three steps:
1. Initiation: tRNA carrying methionine attaches to start codon AUG of mRNA. Ribosome binds to mRNA at the start codon AUG. 
2. Elongation: tRNAs deliver their corresponding amino acids to ribosome. Each tRNA anticodon attaches to the next codon on mRNA. Amino acids link together by peptide bonds. Empty tRNAs leave the ribosome. 
3. Termination: The stop codon is reached. Polypeptide is released. Polypeptide spontaneously folds into 3D protein, and further processing is done into quaternary structures. 

### Gene Expression
Gene expression is needed for certain enzymes to germinate, for trees to undergo secondary growth, for leaf cell enzymes
