## Plant Growth
**Meristems** produces undifferentiated parenchyma cells that develop into various tissues. 
Primary meristems are responsible for **primary growth**, which consists of apical meristems (buds) found at shoot and root tips, produce primary tissues that develop into main organs, and produce axillary buds that develop into new branches. 
Secondary meristems are responsible for **secondary growth**, which consists of the plant increasing in diam
