## Plant Growth
**Meristems** produces undifferentiated parenchyma cells that develop into various tissues. 
Primary meristems are responsible for **primary growth**, which consists of apical meristems (buds) found at shoot and root tips, produce primary tissues that develop into main organs, and produce axillary buds that develop into new branches. 
Secondary meristems are responsible for **secondary growth**, which consists of the plant increasing in diameter and producing wood and bark in woody plants. 

## Primary Meristems
The meristems are regions of active cell division. The apical (primary) meristems lay down new cells below itself, so the meristems grow upward. 
The apical meristem, or bud, dominates growth to allow the plant to grow towards the light, which is called **phototropism**. This is called apical dominance. Thus, when the axillary buds are removed, energy is diverted to lateral growth. 

### Three Primary Tissue Types
The primary meristems produce three types of cells:
1. Dermal tissue: The protective outer layer (skin) of the plant
2. Vascular tissue: the transport system of the plant
3. Ground tissue: the support, storage, and photosynthesis support of the plant. 

#### Dermal tissue
This is a complex tissue that forms a protective outer layer to protect the plant from water loss, pathogens, and physical damage. 
There are four components:
1. Epidermis: cell layer forming "skin" of stems, leaves, and roots. 
2. Cuticle: Waxy layer that sheds water and reduces water loss. 
3. Guard cells: regulates gas exchange by opening/closing stomata. 
4. Trichomes: hair-like structures that deter herbivores, regulate temperature, regulate water loss, etc. 

#### Vascular Tissue
Complex tissue that creates the internal transport system. It moves water, nutrients, and sugars throughout the plant. There are two main types:
1. Xylem: transports water and minerals from roots to leaves. 
2. Phloem: transports sugars from leaves to the rest of the plant. 

#### Ground tissue
Simple tissues that comprise bulk of plant body. They fill space and provide basic functions like structure and metabolism. 
1. Parenchyma: Performs photosynthesis, stores nutrients, fill spaces
2. Collenchyma: provides flexible structure support
3. Sclerenchyma: offers rigid support. 

### Plant Structure
Herbaceous plants have no wood, are shorter in stature, live shorter, and don't have secondary growth. Woody plants have stems reinforced with lignin, which includes trees (woody plants with a dominant stem) and shrubs (woody plant with multiple stems). They grow in diameter through secondary growth and have a taller stature and longer lifespan. 

There are two types of **external cues** that could affect growth: **abiotic** and **biotic**. Pathogens, toxins from herbivores, soil microbes, and more are considered biotic. 

There are three types of **internal cues**: **essential nutrients** (N, P, K), **vitamins and minerals** (like Fe, Mg+, etc) which act as $e-$ acceptors and enzyme cofactors, and **hormones**, which are produced in-plant and are transported where needed. 

## Phototropism
An act mediated by Auxin, this allows plants to grow towards the light. Auxin is delivered to the side of the stem opposite to the light so the cells elongate more there, which bends the stem towards the light. 

Plants respond to these internal and external stimuli with signal transduction pathways. This is where the cell membrane proteins receive signals from hormone or environmental stimulus. The signal is passed through a series of secondary messenger molecules, and the cell response is activated (which allows for changes in transport access membranes, changes in enzymes to be produced, a release or suppression of other hormones, etc). 

### Hormones
There are hundreds of compounds in the five main classes of hormones. These regulate growth, development, etc. They trigger signal transduction pathways, and can have powerful effects in tiny amounts. 
The five main hormones are:
1. **Auxins**: regulates locations of cell growth; mediates phototropism; delays ripening and leaf drop. Similar to a **growth hormone**. 
2. **Cytokinins**: regulates cell division within G2/M transition. Works with auxin to stimulate the **break of dormancy**. Like an **activating hormone**. 
3. **Gibberellins (GA)**: promotes cell elongation, speeds up germination and flowering. **Stretching and speeding hormone** (makes plant taller). 
4. **Abscisic Acid (ABA)**: Inhibits growth. Promotes dormancy in buds and seeds. Also regulates water stress response. **Inhibiting (slowing) hormone**. 
5. **Ethylene**: A gas that promotes fruit ripening and flower and leaf dropping. **Ripening hormone**. 

### Phenology
The timing of growth, reproduction, and senescence in plants. Senescence is the aging and death of tissues, organs, or the whole plant. 
Plant lifespans exist in **annuals** (1 year), **biennials** (2 years), and **perennials** (>2)
