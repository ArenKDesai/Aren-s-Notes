There are traditionally three methods of solving ML problems:
1. Pretrained
2. AutoML
3. Custom
Typically, solving an ML problem starts with a pretrained model since it's the fastest and easiest method. You move down to AutoML or custom models accordingly. 

Google pretrained models are:
1. Vision AI
2. Video AI
3. Natural Language AI
4. Translation AI
5. Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech AI
and solutions that include pretrained models include:
6. Document AI
7. Contact Center AI

Structured data with well-defined schemas typically take advantage of BigQuery ML or Vertex AI Tables. 
Classification problems with a table typically use the metrics AUC ROC, AUC PR, Logloss, Precision at Recall, and Recall at Precision. 
Regression problems with a table typically use RMSE, RMSLE, MAE. 
Forecasting problems with time-series data typically use RMSE, RMSLE, MAPE, and Quantile loss.
