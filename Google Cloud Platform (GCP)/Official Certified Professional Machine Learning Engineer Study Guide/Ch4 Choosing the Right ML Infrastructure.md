There are traditionally three methods of solving ML problems:
1. Pretrained
2. AutoML
3. Custom
Typically, solving an ML problem starts with a pretrained model since it's the fastest and easiest method. You move down to AutoML or custom models accordingly. 

Google pretrained models are:
1. Vision AI
2. Video AI
3. Natural Language AI
4. Translation AI
5. Speech-to-
