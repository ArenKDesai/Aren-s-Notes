Most projects begin with data collection and exploratory data analysis (EDA), both of which can take up the bulk of a project. 

There's two ways to visualize data:
1. Univariate analysis. Analyze each feature independently, including range of the feature and whether outliers exist. Typically box plots and distribution plots. 
2. Bivariate analysis.
