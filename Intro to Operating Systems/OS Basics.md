An operating system (OS) abstracts and manages hardware resources for applications. Provides a set of utilities to simplify app development. 
These resources include CPU, volatile storage (disks), network comms, I/O devices, etc. 

Operating systems take care of virtualization, concurrency, and persistence. They promote the usage of hardware resources through OS policies. 

The OS provides a standard library of a few hundred system calls that are available to applications.
