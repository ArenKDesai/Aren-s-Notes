All cells have a cell membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA. However, only prokaryotes are smaller and less complex, have no nucleus (DNA floats around), no organelles, and are always unicellular. Only Eukaryotes have are larger and more complex, have DNA in a nucleus, diverse organelles, and mostly are multicellular. 

Endosynmiont theory states that organelles inside eukaryotes originated from bacteria. Cyanobacteria were engulfed but not digested, as they could undergo photosynthesis. 

### Nucleotides
Nucleotides = N-base + 5C sugar + phosphate
Deoxyribosenucleic acid = DNA (the genetic code) contains 4 bases: Adenine, Guanine, Cytosines, and Thymines. 

RNA (Ribonucleic acid) replaces Thymine with Uracil. RNA is usually in a single chain. 
Dehydration synthesis forms DNA. 
Amino acids have an R group and a carboxyl group
nucleic acids have a long hydrocarbon tail

### Eukaryotes
Multicellular plants. They have membrane-bound organelles, and DNA enclosed in a nucleus. They have a cytoskeleton, and some have cell walls of cellulose or chitin. 

#### Plasmolysis
When there's too many solutes outside the cell, so water moves out of the cell and the cell membrane separates from the cell wall. 

## Cell Wall
Prevents cytolysis alongside
