Metabolic processes are processes required to maintain life. For example, photosynthesis. 

CO2 diffuses into a plants' leaves through the stomata, and water through the roots. Light is collected by the leaves with chlorophyll. 

Photosynthesis is a two-part process, including the light-dependent and dark-dependent reactions. The dark reactions are often called teh Calvin cycle.
