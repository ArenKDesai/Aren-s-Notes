Metabolic processes are processes required to maintain life. For example, photosynthesis. 

CO2 diffuses into a plants' leaves through the stomata, and water through the roots. Light is collected by the leaves with chlorophyll. 
Many of the chlorophylls are in the mesophyll cells. Chlorophyll is embedded in chloroplast thylakoid. 

Photosynthesis is a two-part process, including the light-dependent and dark-dependent reactions. The dark reactions are often called the Calvin cycle. 

## Calvin Cycle
### Light Reactions
1. Light excites elections in chlorophyll
2. Water is oxidized, producing oxygen as by-product
3. Energy molecules (NADPH and ATP) are produced. 
Chlorophyll molecules reflect green light (around $\lambda \approx 550$) and absorb blue light $\approx 440-680$. 

### Dark Reactions
1. Carbon dioxide is reduced, which fixes it into sugar (using NADPH and ATP)
2. Glucose is produced. 

Major steps:
1. Rubisco binds CO2 to 5-C RuBP to make 2 molecules of PGA
2.
