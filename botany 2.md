## Fungi
Fungi are eukaryotic with nuclei and mitochondria. They are heterotrophic, and absorb nutrition via osmotrophy. They have a cell wall, chitin, and store food as glycogen. 
Yeasts are considered a type of fungi. The same goes for **mycelium**, which are groups of **hyphae**. 
Fungal structures are comprised of **hyphae**, including fungal fruiting bodies and rhizomorphs. For example, *Armillaria* is called the "humungous fungus". 
**Saprobes** are decomposing fungi that are integral for breaking down trees. 
Some fungi are parasites, and some are pathogens. Parasites don't typically cause death or disease (although they can be harmful), but pathogens typically are. 
**Mutualists** obtain organic food from living organisms and provide some benefit in return. 

Fungi formed more than a billion years ago an contributed to the development of plants and animals we know today. 

One fungal **phyla** is **Chytridiomycota**, or **Chytrids**. They're unicellular, their spores have flagella that allow them to move through water. They're found in aquatic environments and soil, and parasitize protists. 
Another phyla is **Zoopagomycota**. These are related to animals, most often insects. They include insect pathogens such as **Entomophthora** that fills the body of a fly with hyphae, controls its behavior, and spreads its spores to other flies. 
Another phyla is **Mucoromycota**. This is terrestrial, mostly saprobic fungi. They're made of hyphae without cross-walls, and produce asexual spores in sporangia. They also produce sexual spores called zygospores. 
Another phyla is **Glomeromycota**. These are terrestrial, mutualistic fungi that are **obligate symbionts** that live with cyanobacteria or plants. When in plants, they are **Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AM Fungi)**. Their hyphae lack cross-walls and produce large, multi-nucleate spores. 

Ascomycota have an interesting life cycle starting with plasmogamy (two cells merge membrane)
