## Fungi
Fungi are eukaryotic with nuclei and mitochondria. They are heterotrophic, and absorb nutrition via osmotrophy. They have a cell wall, chitin, and store food as glycogen. 
Yeasts are considered a type of fungi. The same goes for **mycelium**, which are groups of **hyphae**. 
Fungao structures are comprised of **hyphae**, including fungal fruiting bodies and rhizomorphs. For example, *Armillaria* is called the "humungous fungus". 
**Saprobes** are decomposing fungi that are integral for breaking down trees. 
Some fungi are parasites, and some are pathogens. Parasites don't typically cause death or disease (although they can be harmful), but pathogens typically are. 
**Mutualists** obtain organic food from living organisms and provide some benefit in return.
