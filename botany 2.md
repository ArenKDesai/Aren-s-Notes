## Fungi
Fungi are eukaryotic with nuclei and mitochondria. They are heterotrophic, and absorb nutrition via osmotrophy. They have a cell wall, chitin, and store food as glycogen. 
Yeasts are considered a type of fungi. The same goes for **mycelium**, which are groups of **hyphae**. 
Fungao structures are comprised of **hyphae**, including fungal fruiting bodies and rhizomorphs. For example, *Armillaria* is called the "humungous fungus". 
**Saprobes** are decomposing fungi that are integral for breaking down trees. 
Some fungi are parasites, and some are pathogens. They can cause death and disease,
