Intractability is defining problems that can be solved in polynomial (P) vs non-polynomial (NP) time. In other words, easy vs hard. 
NP problems are categorized in NP-hard and NP-complete. 

Most of the previous algos problems have been optimization problems. We will now analyze decision problems, where there is a binary yes/no answer. For example:
Given a bipartite graph $G$, 
*Optimization*: Find the largest match
