## Botany Basics

Botany studies plants, algae, and fungi. It includes plant ecology, anatomy, physiology, economic botany, ethnobotany, mycology, phycology, etc. Applied botany includes agronomy, horticulture, forestry, etc. 

Photosynthesis can be summarized into the formula: $6CO_2+12H_2O->C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2+6H_2O$
Light reactions: Water split, produces oxygen. 
Dark reactions (Calvin cycle): $CO_2$ is reduced, producing sugar. 

Cellular respiration: $C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2->6CO_2+6H_2O$. The $6O_2$ is used as energy. 

The oxygen that plants produce interacts with UV (UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C) rays in the atmosphere to create the ozone ($O_3$) layer, which shields us from radiation. 

Protists are organisms that are not bacteria, archea, fungi, animals, or plants.

## Onto Plants

Plants are eukaryotic (advanced), multicellular, sessile (arose from unicellular ancestors) organisms. They have rigid cell walls of cellulose that animal cells don't have. 
Trees are woody plants with a single dominant stem. Shrubs have multiple stems, and herbs don't have wood. 
Animals, on the other hand, don't have structure, and rely on bones. 

Plants also conduct photosynthesis using chlorophyll (photoautotrophic, as opposed to heterotrophic or regularly autotrophic). They have an "alternation of generations" where their life cycle includes haploid gametophyte & diploid sporophyte

However, epiphytes are plants not rooted in soil for all or part of their life. Typically, this is other plants or man-made structures. 
Cacti are photosynthetic with a water-storing stem that has spines for leaves. 

Carnivorous plants feed on insects or are otherwise heterotrophic, while non-photosynthetic plants get nutrients from parasites, mycoheterotrophs, etc. 

The smallest plant is <2 mm long (wolffia arrhiza), while the largest is > 100 m tall (eucalyptus trees). 

Most plants are photosynthetic, but some are not, such as mistletoe. Plant cells are also typically composed of cellulose. 

To be considered a plant, typically:
1. composed of many cells
2. cellulose-rich walls
3. have chloroform
4. are photosynthetic (or from photosynthetic anscestors)
5. are adapted to ways of life on land

Plants are known as embryophytes since they possess embryos. 

### Flowering Plants
Angiosperms are flowering plants. Think stems, leaves, roots, flowers, fruits, buds, etc. Flowering plants gradually produce something that falls or gets picked off. Buds are the growing points, where branches, fruits, flowers, etc. grow from. 
Non-angiosperms are gymnosperms, which produce seeds but no flowers. 
Pteridophytes (ferns) don't have seeds or flowers. They have spores. 
Lycophytes (club mosses) have spores, but no flowers, seeds, and no leaves. 
Finally, bryophytes (mosses) have no vascular tissue, flowers, seeds, etc. 

## Origin of Plants
541,000,000 years ago, the Phanerozoic era started. The land was barren of any plant so
