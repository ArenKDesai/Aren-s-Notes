## Agriculture
Agriculture originated around 12,000-5,000 years ago. 
Started with grains (grasses) and legumes (beans, peas). The seeds were dry and easy to transport. Cereals + legumes supply all 20 amino acids. 
Monoculture is the practice of farming a single type of crop, which is vulnerable to disease and parasites. 
Chinampas cultivation was invented by the Tehuacan Valley inhabitants. These are raised, linear soil beds where a mixture of crops is grown. This is known as polyculture. 
For all corn creation, 35% is for animal feed, only 2% for human consumption. 
Rice is the primary food for 50% of the world's population. 
Soy started in East Asia, but now the world's biggest producer is Brazil. 90% is used for livestock feed, and is the #2 threat to the Amazon rainforest.
