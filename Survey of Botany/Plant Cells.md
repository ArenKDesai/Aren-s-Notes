All cells have a cell membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA. However, only prokaryotes are smaller and less complex, have no nucleus (DNA floats around), no organelles, and are always unicellular. Only Eukaryotes have are larger and more complex, have DNA in a nucleus, diverse organelles, and mostly are multicellular. 

Endosynmiont theory states that organelles inside eukaryotes originated from bacteria. Cyanobacteria were engulfed but not digested, as they could undergo photosynthesis. 

### Nucleotides
Nucleotides = N-base + 5C sugar + phosphate
Deoxyribosenucleic acid = DNA (the genetic code) contains 4 bases: Adenine, Guanine, Cytosines, and Thymines. 

RNA (Ribonucleic acid) replaces Thymine with Uracil. RNA is usually in a single chain. 
Dehydration synthesis forms DNA. 
Amino acids have an R group and a carboxyl group
nucleic acids have a long hydrocarbon tail

Amino acid chains for peptide bonds (polypeptides). 20 amino acids are defined by R-group. 
Structural proteins rely on enzymes to turn things on/off. 

DNA and RNA are made of nucleotides (N-base + 5C sugar + phosphate). DNA contains the AT / CG pairs and is double stranded (unless undergoing polymerase stripping). RNA swaps T(hymine) for U(racil), and is a single strand. 

**exons** are sets of useful DNA and **introns** are useless. DNA is wound around histomes. 
Structural Genes: regions of the DNA that code for a particular protein. Usually 1000 kilobases long. Some traits are controlled via >1 gene. Each amino acid is coded by 3 nucleotides, known as a **triplet codon**. 

### Eukaryotes
Multicellular plants. They have membrane-bound organelles, and DNA enclosed in a nucleus. They have a cytoskeleton, and some have cell walls of cellulose or chitin. 

#### Plasmolysis
When there's too many solutes outside the cell, so water moves out of the cell and the cell membrane separates from the cell wall. 

### Cell Wall
Prevents cytolysis alongside physical protection. Provides structural support of plant, and positive pressure in plant tissues keeps water moving up the stem to the leaves. Plants store water in a large central vacuole

Plasmodesmata connects adjoining cells through pores in the cell wall. 

## Cell Cycle
Eukaryotes have 1000x the DNA of prokaryotes, and the DNA is more complex. The DNA is tightly wound to fit in the cell. 
The cell cycle occurs in prokaryotes and chloroplasts. It allows plants to increase in size, repair damaged tissues, and develop specialized cells for different functions. 
The cell cycle includes **interphase**, which is 90% of the cycle, and **mitosis**, which is 10%. Interphase is where the cell grows and prepares for division. This starts with the **G1 Phase**, where the cell grows, makes membranes and organelles, and differentiates. Then comes the **S Phase**, where DNA synthesis occurs. each chromosome is replicated. **G2 Phase** is a gap to prepare for mitosis. 

DNA is made of 4 nucleotides --- Adenine and Thymine, and Cytosine and Guanine --- and the strands are complementary. 

Unlike eukaryotes, prokaryotes don't have the cell cycle. Instead, they divide through binary fission. This is because they have no nucleus (circular DNA in nucleoid), their DNA replicates, etc. 
### Mitosis
This is where the cell divides. 
The first phase is **prophase**, the step where chromosomes condense into chromatids, spindle microtubules form, and the nuclear envelope disintegrates. 
The second phase is **metaphase**, where chromatids align to the center of the cell and the mitotic spindle attaches to centromeres. 
The third phase is **anaphase**, where sister chromatids separate to opposite ends. 
The fourth phase is **telophase**, where a new nuclei forms and the cell plate initiates. 
The fifth phase is **cytokinesis**, where the cell plate continues to form and the cell plate develops into a a new cell wall, separating the daughter cells. 

Mitosis is different in plants and animals. For plants, there are no centrioles, instead using microtubule organizing centers instead. The cell plate forms by building a new wall to divide the cytoplasm, and there's **Merisem-based growth**. 

### Cell Cycle Checkpoints
The cell cycle can be halted at each checkpoint. The first is at the G1/S checkpoint, which checks whether the cell is too small, doesn't have enough energy, is on a different path, etc. 
The second checkpoint is at the G2/M phase, which checks for DNA replication errors. 
Finally, mitosis will not proceed if chromosomes are not aligned properly. 

### Cell Elongation (Growth)
Growth requires water and light (photosynthesis). Cell elongation occurs in the G1 phase, where the vacuole expands and the cell walls loosen. Additional cell membrane and walls form, and the cell becomes receptive to signals that initiate **specialization**. Specialization allows cells to aquire a special function. 

## DNA Replication
When DNA replicates, we need to replicate every chromosome. Helicase (all enzymes end in "ase") exists to unzip the DNA. Then, primase starts the new strand, and DNA polymerase adds the rest of the bases. Ligase glues the two separate strands back together. This all happens in the S phase. 
RNA includes:
1. mRNA: transcribes DNA code during transcription and carries to ribosome
2. tRNA: transfers amino acids to mRNA during translation to build polypeptides. 
3. rRNA: ribosomal RNA: building block of ribosome. 

The non-coding regions are the other parts of the DNA that are non-genes. This can be up to 95% or more of the DNA. This could code for gene expression regulators, spacers (known as **introns**), centomeres and telomeres, genes to make RNA, etc. 

Each amino acid corresponds to a 3 nucleotide **codon**. There are 20 amino acids total, 9 of which humans can only get from food. 

Each amino acid is coded by a 3-nucleotide codon and there are 4 nucleotides for RNA, so there are $4^3=64$ possible codons. AUG is the "start" codon. There are three stop codons: UGA, UAA, and UAG. 

Transfer RNA (tRNA) is always floating around the cytoplasm, made in the nucleus. It's a specialized folding of a single strand of RNA that is held together by hydrogen bonds. An **anticodon** attaches to mRNA. 

Synthetase is an enzyme that binds amino acids to tRNA and recognizes the R-group. There's a unique tRNA for each amino acid matched to A.A. by its 3 nucleotide anticodon. Complementary to mRNA codon. 

### The Processes
There are two main stages: 
1. Transcription: DNA -> mRNA
2. Translation: mRNA -> Protein

#### Transcription
Occurs in the nucleus. The process:
1. DNA unwinds. RNA polymerase binds to promoter region of a gene. 
2. mRNA synthesis. 
3. mRNA processing. Introns are removed, exons are spliced together, a protective cap and tail are added. 
The finished mRNA strand exits the nucleus and a ribosome finds it. 

#### Translation
This occurs in the cytoplasm at the ribosome. mRNA carries the genetic code, tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome, and the ribosome assembles proteins. Three steps:
1. Initiation: tRNA carrying methionine attaches to start codon AUG of mRNA. Ribosome binds to mRNA at the start codon AUG. 
2. Elongation: tRNAs deliver their corresponding amino acids to ribosome. Each tRNA anticodon attaches to the next codon on mRNA. Amino acids link together by peptide bonds. Empty tRNAs leave the ribosome. 
3. Termination: The stop codon is reached. Polypeptide is released. Polypeptide spontaneously folds into 3D protein, and further processing is done into quaternary structures. 

### Gene Expression
Gene expression is needed for certain enzymes to germinate, for trees to undergo secondary growth, for leaf cell enzymes to start photosynthesis, for root cells that need enzymes for nutrient uptake, etc. 
Transcription factors can enhance or suppress transcription, so a lot of gene regulation occurs here. mRNA processing may be modified or halted here. Finally, mRNA transport out of the nucleus may be delayed or prevented. 
Ribosomes or Polypeptide may be modified in many ways, changing results of translation.
