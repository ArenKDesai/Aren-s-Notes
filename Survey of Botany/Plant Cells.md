All cells have a cell membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA. However, only prokaryotes are smaller and less complex, have no nucleus (DNA floats around), no organelles, and are always unicellular. Only Eukaryotes have are larger and more complex, have DNA in a nucleus, diverse organelles, and mostly are multicellular. 

Endosynmiont theory states that organelles inside eukaryotes originated from bacteria. Cyanobacteria were engulfed but not digested, as they could undergo photosynthesis. 

### Nucleotides
Nucleotides = N-base + 5C sugar + phosphate
Deoxyribosenucleic acid = DNA (the genetic code) contains 4 bases: Adenine, Guanine, Cytosines, and Thymines. 

RNA (Ribonucleic acid) replaces Thymine with Uracil. RNA is usually in a single chain. 
Dehydration synthesis forms DNA. 
Amino acids have an R group and a carboxyl group
nucleic acids have a long hydrocarbon tail

### Eukaryotes
Multicellular plants. They have membrane-bound organelles, and DNA enclosed in a nucleus. They have a cytoskeleton, and some have cell walls of cellulose or chitin. 

#### Plasmolysis
When there's too many solutes outside the cell, so water moves out of the cell and the cell membrane separates from the cell wall. 

### Cell Wall
Prevents cytolysis alongside physical protection. Provides structural support of plant, and positive pressure in plant tissues keeps water moving up the stem to the leaves. Plants store water in a large central vacuole

Plasmodesmata connects adjoining cells through pores in the cell wall. 

## Cell Cycle
Eukaryotes have 1000x the DNA of prokaryotes, and the DNA is more complex. The DNA is tightly wound to fit in the cell. 
The cell cycle occurs in prokaryotes and chloroplasts. It allows plants to increase in size, repair damaged tissues, and develop specialized cells for different functions. 
The cell cycle includes **interphase**, which is 90% of the cycle, and **mitosis**, which is 10%. Interphase is where the cell grows and prepares for division. This starts with the **G1** 

Unlike eukaryotes, prokaryotes don't have the cell cycle. Instead, they divide through binary fission. This is because they have no nucleus (circular DNA in nucleoid), their DNA replicates, etc.
