Much of this is an extension of [[Plant Cells]]
## Plant Organs
The cell organs are made up of different tissues. 

Plant cells are primarily separated into three types to manage these organs. 
These are **Parenchyma**, **Collenchyma**, and **Sclerenchyma** cells. 
There's also simple tissues, made of only one cell type, or complex tissues, which are made of more than one type. 
Other types also exist, such as trichomes or endodermis. 

### Parenchyma
The basic plant cell. When cell division occurs, the cell starts as a parenchyma cell. These are thin-walled, actively dividing, and have diverse functions. These include leaf mesophyll, pith of stem, and the inside of a potato. 

### Collenchyma
Simple tissues made up of one cell type. These are supportive tissue. 

### Sclerenchyma
Hard cells that are even more thickened and hard than collenchyma cells. These are what make wood. These tend to be permanent, while parenchyma and collenchyma cells may transition between each other. 
There are two main types: sclereids (stone cells) and fibers. These include the coconut shell, the peach pit, etc. 

### Cell Differentiation
Cells often differentiate during G1 (see [[Plant Cells]]), where cells are receptive to chemical and environmental cues. 
The G1/S checkpoint checks whether the cell is fit to continue, in if not, they go in the **G0/Stasis** state. This is the resting, or statis state. This is a non-diving, mature state. 

## Meristems
**Meristems** produces undifferentiated parenchyma cells that develop into various tissues. 
Primary meristems are responsible for **primary growth**, which consists of apical meristems (buds) found at shoot and root tips, produce primary tissues that develop into main organs, and produce axillary buds that develop into new branches. 
Secondary meristems are responsible for **secondary growth**, which consists of the plant increasing in diameter and producing wood and bark in woody plants. 

The meristems are regions of active cell division. The apical (primary) meristems lay down new cells below itself, so the meristems grow upward. 
The apical meristem, or bud, dominates growth to allow the plant to grow towards the light, which is called **phototropism**. This is called apical dominance. Thus, when the axillary buds are removed, energy is diverted to lateral growth. 

The primary meristems produce three types of cells:
1. Dermal tissue: The protective outer layer (skin) of the plant
2. Vascular tissue: the transport system of the plant
3. Ground tissue: the support, storage, and photosynthesis support of the plant. 
#### Dermal tissue
This is a complex tissue that forms a protective outer layer to protect the plant from water loss, pathogens, and physical damage. 
There are four components:
1. Epidermis: cell layer forming "skin" of stems, leaves, and roots. 
2. Cuticle: Waxy layer that sheds water and reduces water loss. 
3. Guard cells: regulates gas exchange by opening/closing stomata. 
4. Trichomes: hair-like structures that deter herbivores, regulate temperature, regulate water loss, etc. 

#### Vascular Tissue
Complex tissue that creates the internal transport system. It moves water, nutrients, and sugars throughout the plant. There are two main types:
1. Xylem: transports water and minerals from roots to leaves. 
2. Phloem: transports sugars from leaves to the rest of the plant. 

#### Ground tissue
Simple tissues that comprise bulk of plant body. They fill space and provide basic functions like structure and metabolism. 
1. Parenchyma: Performs photosynthesis, stores nutrients, fill spaces
2. Collenchyma: provides flexible structure support
3. Sclerenchyma: offers rigid support.
