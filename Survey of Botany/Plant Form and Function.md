Much of this is an extension of [[Plant Cells]]
## Plant Organs
The cell organs are made up of different tissues. 

Plant cells are primarily separated into three types to manage these organs. 
These are **Parenchyma**, **Collenchyma**, and **Sclerenchyma** cells. 
There's also simple tissues, made of only one cell type, or complex tissues, which are made of more than one type. 
Other types also exist, such as trichomes or endodermis. 

### Parenchyma
The basic plant cell. When cell division occurs, the cell starts as a parenchyma cell. These are thin-walled, actively dividing, and have diverse functions. These include leaf mesophyll, pith of stem, and the inside of a potato. 

### Collenchyma
Simple tissues made up of one cell type. These are supportive tissue. 

### Sclerenchyma
Hard cells that are even more thickened and hard than collenchyma cells. These are what make wood. These tend to be permanent, while parenchyma and collenchyma cells may transition between each other. 
There are two main types: sclereids (stone cells) and fibers. These include the coconut shell, the peach pit, etc. 

### Cell Differentiation
Cells often differentiate during G1 (see [[Plant Cells]]), where cells are receptive to chemical and environmental cues. 
The G1/S checkpoint checks whether the cell is fit to continue, in if not, they go in the **G0/Stasis** state. This is the resting, or statis state. This is a non-diving, mature state. 

## Meristems
**Meristems** produces undifferentiated parenchyma cells that develop into various tissues. 
Primary meristems are responsible for **primary growth**, which consists of apical meristems (buds) found at shoot and root tips, produce primary tissues that develop into main organs, and produce axillary buds that develop into new branches. 
Secondary meristems are responsible for **secondary growth**, which consists of the plant increasing in diameter and producing wood and bark in woody plants. 

The meristems are regions of active cell division. The apical (primary) meristems lay down new cells below itself, so the meristems grow upward. 
The apical meristem, or bud, dominates growth to allow the plant to grow towards the light, which is called **phototropism**. This is called apical dominance. Thus, when the axillary buds are removed, energy is diverted to lateral growth. 

The primary meristems produce three types of cells:
1. Dermal tissue: The protective outer layer (skin) of the plant
2. Vascular tissue: the transport system of the plant
3. Ground tissue: the support, storage, and photosynthesis support of the plant. 

### Dermal tissue
This is a complex tissue that forms a protective outer layer to protect the plant from water loss, pathogens, and physical damage. 
There are four components:
1. Epidermis: cell layer forming "skin" of stems, leaves, and roots. 
2. Cuticle: Waxy layer that sheds water and reduces water loss. 
3. Guard cells: regulates gas exchange by opening/closing stomata. 
4. Trichomes: hair-like structures that deter herbivores, regulate temperature, regulate water loss, etc. 

### Vascular Tissue
Complex tissue that creates the internal transport system. It moves water, nutrients, and sugars throughout the plant. There are two main types:
1. Xylem: transports water and minerals from roots to leaves. 
2. Phloem: transports sugars from leaves to the rest of the plant. 

### Ground tissue
Simple tissues that comprise bulk of plant body. They fill space and provide basic functions like structure and metabolism. 
1. Parenchyma: Performs photosynthesis, stores nutrients, fill spaces
2. Collenchyma: provides flexible structure support
3. Sclerenchyma: offers rigid support. 

### Plant Structure and Cues
Herbaceous plants have no wood, are shorter in stature, live shorter, and don't have secondary growth. Woody plants have stems reinforced with lignin, which includes trees (woody plants with a dominant stem) and shrubs (woody plant with multiple stems). They grow in diameter through secondary growth and have a taller stature and longer lifespan. 

There are two types of **external cues** that could affect growth: **abiotic** and **biotic**. Pathogens, toxins from herbivores, soil microbes, and more are considered biotic. 

There are three types of **internal cues**: **essential nutrients** (N, P, K), **vitamins and minerals** (like Fe, Mg+, etc) which act as $e^-$ acceptors and enzyme cofactors, and **hormones**, which are produced in-plant and are transported where needed. 

### Phototropism
An act mediated by Auxin, this allows plants to grow towards the light. Auxin is delivered to the side of the stem opposite to the light so the cells elongate more there, which bends the stem towards the light. 

Plants respond to these internal and external stimuli with signal transduction pathways. This is where the cell membrane proteins receive signals from hormone or environmental stimulus. The signal is passed through a series of secondary messenger molecules, and the cell response is activated (which allows for changes in transport access membranes, changes in enzymes to be produced, a release or suppression of other hormones, etc). 

### Hormones
There are hundreds of compounds in the five main classes of hormones. These regulate growth, development, etc. They trigger signal transduction pathways, and can have powerful effects in tiny amounts. 
The five main hormones are:
1. **Auxins**: regulates locations of cell growth; mediates phototropism; delays ripening and leaf drop. Similar to a **growth hormone**. 
2. **Cytokinins**: regulates cell division within G2/M transition. Works with auxin to stimulate the **break of dormancy**. Like an **activating hormone**. 
3. **Gibberellins (GA)**: promotes cell elongation, speeds up germination and flowering. **Stretching and speeding hormone** (makes plant taller). 
4. **Abscisic Acid (ABA)**: Inhibits growth. Promotes dormancy in buds and seeds. Also regulates water stress response. **Inhibiting (slowing) hormone**. 
5. **Ethylene**: A gas that promotes fruit ripening and flower and leaf dropping. **Ripening hormone**. 

### Phenology
The timing of growth, reproduction, and senescence in plants. Senescence is the aging and death of tissues, organs, or the whole plant. 
Plant lifespans exist in **annuals** (1 year), **biennials** (2 years), and **perennials** (>2 years). Some plants (trees) are >5,000 years old. 
Some also have year-round growth in the tropics, where the plants are often **evergreen** (always have leaves). 
Some have seasonal growth, where annual periods of freezing or drought don't allow permanent growth. These are **deciduous** plants that lose their leaves. 

## Plant Habitats
There are three types of plants that cover habitats:
1. Mesophytes: Live in moderately moist environments
2. Hydrophytes: plants that live in or partly in water
3. Xerophytes: plants that live in arid environments

### Mesophytes
There are typically more adaptions for light rather than water. There can be a lot of shade that disallows lower leaves to produce energy. This separates leaves into **sun leaves** and **shade leaves**. 

### Hydrophytes
Think of lily pad. The stomata are typically on the upper surface on the floating part of the plant, or the leaves just don't have stomata if they're submerged. The aerenchyma are used to facilitate gas exchange and floatation, and there's no (or a thin) cuticle, with less xylem than phloem. 

### Xerophytes
These have adaptations to minimize water loss. This is usually a thick epidermis and cuticle, stomata sunken into cryptes, and energy being allocated to the roots. 

One interesting xerophyte is **cacti** and other **succulents**. These have water-storing tissues to keep as much water as possible. Cacti have leaves modified into spines that reduce water loss and defend the plant, while the stem conducts photosynthesis and store water. Other succulents have thick water-storing leaves as well, and may be moderately spiny. Most succulents have CAM ([[Plant Cells]]) photosynthesis. 

## Plant Reproduction and Life Cycles
As mentioned previously, there are two main types of reproduction for plants:
1. Angiosperms: use flowers to produce seeds
2. Gymnosperms: make seeds w/ no flowers. Instead, cones
Seedless plants (ferns and mosses) disperse offspring w/ **spores**. 
For reproduction in flowers:
- Sperm is in pollen from **anthers** (end bits of flower tendrils, which are the **stamen**)
- **Ovules** (w/ eggs) are in ovary
- Pollination transfers pollen to ovules
- Fertilization fuses egg & sperm
- Embryo in is in seed, which is in fruit
Not all plants have flowers, and not all reproduction is sexual. For example, ferns use spores. Some plants can reproduce sexually and non-sexually. 

All prokaryotes are asexual. They do not have reproductive organs, and instead just kinda divide. Prokaryotes, like green algae, under mitosis, send out **zoospores** and undergo mitosis again. 

### Asexual Reproduction
Produces genetically identical offspring (clones) via mitosis ([[Plant Cells]]). There are a few common methods:
1. **Vegetative propagation**. Plants form as a random number of offshoots, kinda like vertical tree of clones. Ex: runners in strawberries, the "eyes" of potatoes, aspen clones, etc. 
2. **Fragmentation**. A part breaks off and can regrow somewhere else. For example, willows, bryophytes, duckweed, etc. 
3. **Apomixis**. Seeds, or embryos, produced w/o fertilization. 

### Sexual Reproduction
Producing offspring through **meiosis** and fertilization. These are done with **diploids** cells, cells that process two complete sets of chromosomes (one from mom/dad). These chromosomes are **homologous** to each-other, known as **homologs**. **Haploid** cells only have one set of chromosomes (no pairs) because they arise from asexual reproduction. 
So, to summarize:
- A pair of chromosomes is two chromosomes, one paternal and one maternal
- One chromosome is one stick
- Genes are regions of DNA code for a trait
- Allels are different versions of the same gene

Sexual reproduction starts with **meiosis**, cell division that halves homologous chromosomes. Then, **fertilization** occurs, where a fusion of haploid **gametes** produce a diploid cell called a **zygote**. The gametes come from the split homologous chromosomes in the form of sperm or eggs. 

Sexual reproduction allows for much greater genetic variation, which is very beneficial for natural selection. However, it requires a lot of energy, and depends on factors like water, temperature, pollinators, etc. 
Asexual reproduction can take advantage of environmental factors, while sexual reproduction allows for the purging of disadvantageous traits. 

Crossing over, or **recombination**, occurs during prophase. 

### Plant Life Cycle
Plants alternate generations. They alternate between **sporophytes** and **gametophytes**. 
Sporophytes are $2n$ multi-cellular bodies that can generate $2n$ reproductive cells, which undergo meiosis to generate a bunch of $1n$ spores. These grow via mitosis and form a $1n$ multi-cellular body, which generates gametes. 

In plants, meiosis takes place in the **sporangia** of the sporophyte, and produces spores. Flowering plants have male sorangia in anthers, female sporangia in ovary. 

Meiosis has meitosis phases (P->M->A->T), but it has two sets of phases. First, it splits the homologous chromosome pairs. Then, it runs it back to separate the diploid cells into haploid cells.
