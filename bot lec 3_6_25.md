### Stem Modifications
**Rhizomes**: horizontal underground stems for vegetative spread (ginger, bamboo). 
**Tubers and Corms** store stuff underground (potatoes, crocus).
**Vines and Lianas** climb (grape).
**Succulent Stems** store water (cactus). 

## Roots
Roots are made of **Epiderman, Ground, and Vascular** tissue. They take up water, dissolve nutrients in water (nutrient uptake), and produce hormones and compounds. They also anchor the plants in place. 

There's also **Pneumatophores** (air roots) that grow upward, and **prop roots** that stabilize plants and take in oxygen. 

The **root cap** protects the apical meristem. It's at the very bottom of the root.
The **mucigel** secret by the root cap golgi bodies lubricates the root. 
The **root hairs** are extensions of the epidermis for extra surface area. The extra surface area allows the roots to increase **nutrient uptake**, which requires ATP but allows mineral ions to move through transport proteins. 
The **branch roots** emerge from the pericycle and increase anchorage. Most essential nutrients (all but H, O, and C) come from the soil. 

The **apical meristem** gives rise to ground, vascular, and epidermal tissues. It's the end part of the root before the root cap. It's responsible for the the growth of the root. It's also where cell division occurs. 

### Gravitropism
The root can sense gravity through starch grains sinking to the bottom of the cell. This occurs in root cap **amyloplasts**. It triggers the release of growth hormones.
