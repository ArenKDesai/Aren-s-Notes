### SSDs
- Slow for 1GHz devices
- use chips fabricated similarly to CPUs
- speeds closer to CPUs
- No mechanical parts, use transistors
- NAND-based technology
- Higher cost per bit than hard drives, but better performance

### NAND
A NAND flash block is a grid of cells, of the following:
- Single Level Cell: 1 bit per cell (fast, more reliable)
- Multi Level Cell: 2 bits per cell (slower, less reliable)
- Triple Level Cell: 4 bits per cell (even more so)
- Erase: set all bits to 1
- Program: clear some bits
