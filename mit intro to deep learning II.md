## Sequences
In order to model sequences, we need to be able to handle variable-length (non-fixed length) sequences. They also need to track long-term dependencies, where a variable at a smaller time step may influence an outcome near the end of the time steps. Order needs to be maintained, and parameters need to be shared across
