## Agriculture
Agriculture originated around 10,000 years ago. 
Monoculture is the practice of farming a single type of crop, which is vulnerable to disease and parasites. 
Chinampas cultivation was invented by the Tehuacan Valley inhabitants. These are raised, linear soil beds where a mixture of crops is grown. This is known as polyculture.
