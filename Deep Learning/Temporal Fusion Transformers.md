Whitepaper proposing Temporal Fusion Transformers: [Temporal Fusion Transformers for Interpretable Multi-horizon Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09363)

## Purpose
For forecasting or prediction tasks that are highly temporal and multi-horizon (non-singular prediction outcome), we might want a powerful model that's also highly explainable. The temporal fusion transformer
