Whitepaper proposing Temporal Fusion Transformers: [Temporal Fusion Transformers for Interpretable Multi-horizon Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09363)

## Purpose
For forecasting or prediction tasks that are highly temporal and multi-horizon (non-singular prediction outcome), we might want a powerful model that's also highly explainable. The temporal fusion transformer (TFT) is an explainable architecture with those qualities. It allows for predictions multiple time-steps into the future. 
Multi-horizon forecasting models usually have temporal information that's very difficult to organize, such as information about the future, static metadata, and historical time series data.
