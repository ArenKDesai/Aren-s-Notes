With a given $A_{mxm}$, each row of A will provide a G-disc $D_i=D_i(c_i,r_i)$ with center $c_i$ and radius $r_i$.
$c_i=A(i,i), r_i=-|A(i,i)|+\sum^m_{j=1}|A(i,j)|$

### Defined Theorem
Let $U$ be the union of $k$ G-discs, with $1 \le k \le m$. Assume that $U$ is disjoint of each of the other $m-k$ discs. Then $U$ contains exactly $k$ e-values, count algebraic multiplicity.
