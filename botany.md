**Monophyletic group**: a branch or clade that includes one common ancestor and all of its descendants. All members of the group are evolutionarily related. 
Animals and fungi come from one monophyletic group, while plants come from another. 
Unicellular organisms that don't belong to the three above are **protists**. Protists are 75% of all life on Earth, and a notable example is algae, or phytoplankton. Protists are **motile eukaryotes**. Some can form colonies but no complex tissues. Some protists are similar to animals and are called **protozoa**. Protists can be heterotrophic, autotrophic, or mixotrophic. Protists are **motile**, which means that they move (are not sessile), but cannot do so through intent. 

### Algae
Photosynthetic protists that contain plastids. They're often unicellular, but form colonies or larger multicellular bodies. They have filamentous, membranous, blade-like forms. Major groups are distinguished by pigments. They are *not* plants. 
Algal groups are distinguished by cell wall chemistry, storage molecules, and accessory pigments. 
Algae are primary producers in aquatic environments. Algae is food for many organisms, and produce 50% of the world's oxygen. 

One group is the Streptophyte Green Algae. This is order Charales, they're multicellular, they form simple tissues, they have cellulose cell walls with plasmodesmata, and they produce zygotes.
